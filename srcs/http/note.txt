1. Building Request Parser
Aim - raw bytes => object

POST /upload/image.png HTTP/1.1\r\n       <-- Request Line
Host: localhost:8080\r\n                  <-- Headers
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\n
Content-Length: 15\r\n
\r\n                                      <-- The "Double CRLF" (End of headers)
name=john&age=25                          <-- Body (Optional)

But, might receive this info in chunks so need a buffer. => in_buff.

Reading the in_buff?
Idea 1. read(): reads one byte at a time and check if the end of buff is "\r\n\r\n"
Idea 2. read into larger chunks checking if "\r\n\r\n" using strstr() type

2. Request line
verb - what do they want?
target - which file?
protocol - how to talk back?

server looks at the path and checks the config

Get -> opens the file on the disk & reads the content into memory
Delete -> removes the file from the disk
Post -> saves data / runs a calculation

=> generates a status code and content
but this response has to be wrapped in the http response envelope
: create a string that looks like this: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n[The File Data].
then push this back to the browser thru the socket

3. Status code
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)

4. RFC semantic rules
		1. Header Case Insensitivity
		This is the trickiest part for your std::map. By default, std::map<std::string, std::string> treats "Host" and "host" as different keys.

		The Fix: Before inserting or looking up a key in your map, convert the header name to lowercase.

		Code logic: _headerMap[toLower(name)] = value;

		2. Mandatory Host Header
		The subject requires accurate status codes.

		The Fix: After your header loop finishes (when you see \r\n\r\n), check if _headerMap.count("host") is 0.

		Action: If it's missing, immediately set _statusCode = 400 and stop processing the request.

		3. Strict Whitespace (The "No Space Before Colon" Rule)
		This is a common "trick" in 42 projects to see if you read the RFC.

		The Rule: Field-Name ":" [Field-Value]. There is zero space allowed between the name and the colon.

		The Fix: In your while loop that reads the name, if you encounter a space ' ' before you find the ':', the request is malformed.

		Action: Set _statusCode = 400.
