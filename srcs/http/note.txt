1. Building Request Parser
Aim - raw bytes => object

POST /upload/image.png HTTP/1.1\r\n       <-- Request Line
Host: localhost:8080\r\n                  <-- Headers
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\n
Content-Length: 15\r\n
\r\n                                      <-- The "Double CRLF" (End of headers)
name=john&age=25                          <-- Body (Optional)

But, might receive this info in chunks so need a buffer. => in_buff.

Reading the in_buff?
Idea 1. read(): reads one byte at a time and check if the end of buff is "\r\n\r\n"
Idea 2. read into larger chunks checking if "\r\n\r\n" using strstr() type

2. Request line
verb - what do they want?
target - which file?
protocol - how to talk back?

server looks at the path and checks the config

Get -> opens the file on the disk & reads the content into memory
Delete -> removes the file from the disk
Post -> saves data / runs a calculation

=> generates a status code and content
but this response has to be wrapped in the http response envelope
: create a string that looks like this: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n[The File Data].
then push this back to the browser thru the socket
